Terraform module to easily generate AMI snapshots to create replica instances


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).
>
> <details>
> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>
> <img src="https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/master/docs/demo.gif?raw=true"/><br/>
> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>
> </detalis>





## Usage

### Create an AWS instance
```
resource "aws_instance" "default" {
  ami           = "ami-408c7f28"
  instance_type = "t1.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "test1"
  }
}
```

### Create AMI from an AWS instance. Instance ID is required"
```
module "tf_ami_from_instance" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/tf_ami_from_instance.git?ref=master"
  source_instance_id = "${aws_instance.web.id}"
  stage              = "${var.stage}"
  namespace          = "${var.namespace}"
  name               = "${var.name}"
  attributes         = "${var.attributes}"
  tags               = "${var.tags}"
}

```

## Caveats
* Terraform will only keep the latest AMI snapshot (terraform will delete the previously generated AMI) See our Lamda based solution which avoids this pitfall: https://github.com/cloudposse/tf_lambda_ami_backup
* This is is not compatible with autoscaling groups

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
